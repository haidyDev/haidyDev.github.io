# Power App UI Mock – Case Management

## Problem
Need a quick, low-code style UI concept for capturing and tracking simple cases with a status.

## Approach
Build a minimal “Power Apps-like” flow:
- user inputs a case title
- selects status
- adds it to a list (gallery-like list)

## Tech
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GitHub Pages

## Learnings
- Basic form handling
- Simple input validation
- Rendering items into a list

## Future improvements
- Status badges + visual “gallery” layout
- Edit/delete actions
- Persist data (localStorage)
- Role-based views (viewer vs editor)
